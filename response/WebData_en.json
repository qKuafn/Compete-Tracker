Only your first five eliminations in each match will contribute to your match score. The top duos in each region advance to Round 2 and are sorted into one of three groups based on their Round 1 point total: Group 1 (15+ points), Group 2 (10-14 points), and Group 3 (1-9 points). Round 2 mirrors the structure of Round 1, with duos again playing up to three matches in 40 minutes (where all matches count). Only Group 1 duos are eligible to advance to Round 3, with the top 20 from each region progressing. Round 3 will consist of three scheduled matches, where each Victory Royale winner will win a cash prize! Good luck and have fun!",

Each Reload Quick Cup kicks off with Round 1, a 45-minute session where duos can play up to three matches, with only the best match counting on the leaderboard. Only your first five eliminations in each match will contribute to your match score. The top duos in each region advance to Round 2 and are sorted into one of three groups based on their Round 1 point total: Group 1 (15+ points), Group 2 (10-14 points), and Group 3 (1-9 points). Round 2 mirrors the structure of Round 1, with duos again playing up to three matches in 45 minutes (where all matches count). Only Group 1 duos are eligible to advance to Round 3, with the top 20 from each region progressing. Round 3 will consist of three scheduled matches, where each Victory Royale winner will win a cash prize! Good luck and have fun!",
