Only your first five eliminations in each match will contribute to your match score. The top duos in each region advance to Round 2 and are sorted into one of three groups based on their Round 1 point total: Group 1 (15+ points), Group 2 (10-14 points), and Group 3 (1-9 points). Round 2 mirrors the structure of Round 1, with duos again playing up to three matches in 40 minutes (where all matches count). Only Group 1 duos are eligible to advance to Round 3, with the top 20 from each region progressing. Round 3 will consist of three scheduled matches, where each Victory Royale winner will win a cash prize! Good luck and have fun!",
